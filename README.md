# King Past Midnight

## The book club


> Welcome to King Past Midnight!
> 
> We are a book club focusing solely on the works of Stephen King. Our club was initiated by our love and admiration of King’s virtuosity. You can visit our physical book club in New Antwerp, where we offer you copies of all of Stephen King’s books. But you are also welcome to join us here if you read his works without using our King library, of course.
> 
> Upon becoming a member, an administrator will make a user account for you and share the login details with you. Once you log in, you can add the books you have read to your personal collection. You will also be able to view the other members’ collections.
> 
> If you have any questions, please reach out to us. Let the wheel of Ka be on your side!


This is the opening text on the homepage of the **King Past Midnight** book club’s website! It is located in the fictional American city of New Antwerp, and has physical copies of all of Stephen King’s main books. People who do not frequent the book club, but are avid Stephen King readers on their own terms, can also ask for an account and join in, sharing their passion for Stephen King’s books.

When someone visits the website **without logging in**, they will see the introduction text on the homepage, and the Book Of The Month. They will be able to take a look at all the books with some data on the book itself, but no data which involves members of the club. They can also log in, of course, if they have previously requested and received login data.

Once a member **logs in with their personal login details**, they see the same data as before, but now with additional data. For each book, they will see the amount of likes (and be able to like or unlike a book themselves), which members have that book in their collection (which is our way of saying they have actually read the book, and which the user can either add or remove from their own collection), and the comment section, which they can also add comments to. They can also access the Collections overview, which shows all members’ names and the total number of books they have individually read. They can look into any user’s collection, to see which books they have read. Also, by clicking on their own avatar (which, for simplicity reasons, is just the user’s initials on a randomly chosen red or green background), they can go and check on their own collection or log out.

And finally, a member can be an **administrator**. If so, they see the same as a regular member when logged in, however they have the possibility to add, modify or remove members and books. Whether a member is an admin or not, can be defined when adding the member. It can also be modified afterwards. The admin can also mark a book as Book Of The Month when adding or modifying a book. If another book was still/already selected as Book Of The Month, it will be replaced by the newly chosen book. The Book Of The Month is highlighted on the homepage (and can be left there for a shorter or longer time than a month, of course, in principal it’s only a name to mark the highlighted book, but “Book Of The Month” sounds nice, doesn’t it?). If no Book Of The Month is selected, there will be a short sentence on the homepage mentioning that there isn’t one at the moment.

So, that’s the overall idea behind both the King Past Midnight book club (of which the name is based on the collection of Stephen King short stories named Four Past Midnight) and the supporting website.


## The technology

Now, let’s discuss some of the technology used to make the website.

The website has been made with the JavaScript framework **React**.

The following libraries were used:

- React Router
- Redux
- Redux Toolkit
- React Modules

The data is stored in a **Google Firebase database**. This is not really an ideal setup, and for sure one that I would not go for in case of a real-life website or app, but as I did not want to set up a full back-end for this website, Google Firebase was a nice free online choice. This did come with some quirks of its own which needed to be taken into account, but in the end it all worked out fine and was really informative. One can learn a lot from handling databases when you don’t have full control over the database’s structure.

That said, the website is primarily an exercise in React. I had made some apps in React before, but never a full website setup, and this was also the first time I used the more modern functional components approach, rather than the old-school class based components. It was loads of fun, and I learned a lot from setting this up. There are still quite a few pieces of functionality I could add, maybe in the near future, who knows, but for now I kept it within the initial scope.


## Can you see it?

Well of course you can! You can visit the book club’s website here: https://www.wimverpoorten.com/king-past-midnight.

I will not put any admin accounts here, just to ensure the website does not get messed up. The following regular member accounts can be used to see how things work though:

| First Name  | Last Name | Username  | Password |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Jan  | Janssens  | jjanssens  | 8cm4P  |
| Els  | Bekaert  | ebekaert  | 12nn5h  |
| Lode  | Melaerts  | lmelaerts  | 55mo6H  |
| Mindy  | Donckers  | mdonck  | 8pUy2  |
| Jens  | Wachters  | jwacht  | 44QSe2  |
| Ina  | Leenders  | ileend  | 784Kh2  |
| Dirk  | Udens  | dudens  | 8py12N  |
| Lana  | Goyaerts  | lgoya  | 3n0Kj5  |

Feel free to log in with any of those, add or remove books from your collection, like or dislike books, and leave a comment if you wish.

It goes without saying that I would be more than pleased to show you in person how the site looks like and reacts (no pun intended) when logged in as an admin user. Please reach out to me if you are interested in that.


## Conclusion

That concludes this documentation of the King Past Midnight website. If you have any questions or want to reach out, please let me know.

Now, if you’ll excuse me please, I’m going to read some Stephen King books, all this talk about the master’s books have put me in a reading mood!
